#
# OverSIP - Proxies Configuration.
#

# Default proxy configuration.
#
default_proxy:

  # For initial INVITE, SUBSCRIBE and REFER requests and in-dialog NOTIFY the proxy adds Record-Route header(s).
  # For REGISTER requests the proxy adds Path header(s).
  # By default _yes_.
  #
  do_record_routing: yes

  # Enable DNS cache. By default _yes_.
  #
  use_dns_cache: yes

  # DNS cache time (in seconds). A DNS result is removed from the cache after the given time.
  # Minimum value is 300. Default value is 300.
  #
  dns_cache_time: 300

  # Enable destination blacklist. When a destination (target) fails due to timeout, connection error
  # or TLS validation error, the target is added to a temporal blacklist and requests to same
  # targets are not tryed again until the entry in the blacklist expires. By default _yes_.
  #
  use_blacklist: yes

  # Blacklist expiration time (in seconds). The time of live of failed targets within the blacklist.
  #
  blacklist_time: 5

  # Use DNS NAPTR. If set, NAPTR query is performed when URI host is a domain, has no port nor
  # ;transport param.
  # Default value is _yes_.
  #
  use_naptr: yes

  # Use DNS SRV. If set, SRV query is performed when URI host is a domain and has no port.
  # If this is set to _no_ then _use_naptr_ is also set to _no_.
  # Default value is _yes_.
  #
  use_srv: yes

  # Transport preference. The list of supported transports in order of preference.
  # When there is NAPTR record, its SRV records are tryed in this order just in the case
  # _force_transport_preference_ is _yes_.
  # If there is not NAPTR record, SRV records are then tryed in this order.
  # Valid transports are "udp", "tcp" and "tls".
  # Default value is ["tls", "tcp", "udp"] (first try "tls").
  #
  transport_preference: ["tls", "tcp", "udp"]

  # Force transport preference. If _no_, transport preference is taken from NAPTR records
  # (when present). If _yes_, transport preferences are taken from transport_preference
  # parameter even for NAPTR records.
  # Default value is _no_.
  #
  force_transport_preference: no

  # IP type preference. When both IPv4 and IPv6 are available, this parameter determines
  # whether to try first DNS A or AAAA queries. It also determines the IP type this proxy
  # is allowed to use for routing requests.
  # Valid IP types are "ipv4" and "ipv6".
  # Default value is ["ipv4", "ipv6"] (first try "ipv4").
  #
  ip_type_preference: ["ipv4", "ipv6"]

  # DNS failover on received 503.
  # If a DNS query retrieves more than a single destinations and the first attempt
  # receives a 503 response, then OverSIP tries the next destination (when this parameter
  # is set) or replies a 500 error upstream (when not set).
  # Default value is _yes_.
  #
  dns_failover_on_503: yes

  # INVITE transaction timeout (in seconds).
  # Time waiting for a provisional or final response.
  # Minimum value is 2, maximum value is 64.
  # Default value is 32.
  #
  timer_B: 32

  # Proxy INVITE transaction timeout (in seconds).
  # Time waiting for a final response.
  # Minimum value is 8, maximum value is 180.
  # Default value is 120.
  #
  timer_C: 120

  # Non-INVITE transaction timeout (in seconds).
  # Time waiting for a final response.
  # Minimum value is 2, maximum value is 64.
  # Default value is 32.
  #
  timer_F: 32

  # Call the OverSIP::SIP.on_server_tls_handshake() callback when
  # establishing an outbound SIP TLS connection with a remote SIP peer.
  # By default _yes_.
  #
  callback_on_server_tls_handshake: yes
