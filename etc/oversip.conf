#
# OverSIP - Main Configuration.
#

core:

  # DNS nameserver to use. Note that OverSIP requires a recursive DNS server
  # (recommended unbound: a DNS recursive and caching DNS resolver).
  # Value can be:
  # - An IPv4.
  # - An array of IPv4 (for failover).
  # - _null_: nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf are used.
  # Default value is _null_.
  #
  nameservers: null

  # Syslog facility. Can be "kern", "user", "daemon", "local0"..."local7".
  # By default "daemon".
  #
  syslog_facility: daemon

  # Syslog level. Can be "debug", "info", "notice", "warn", "error", "crit".
  # By default "info".
  #
  syslog_level: debug


sip:

  # Use SIP over UDP. By default _yes_.
  #
  sip_udp: yes

  # Use SIP over TCP. By default _yes_.
  #
  sip_tcp: yes

  # Use SIP over TLS. By default _yes_.
  #
  sip_tls: yes

  # Enable or disable IPv4. By default _yes_.
  #
  enable_ipv4: yes

  # IPv4 in which OverSIP listens for SIP messages. Using "0.0.0.0" is not
  # allowed.
  # - Use an IPv4 string for listening in that address.
  # - Use _null_ for IP autodiscovery.
  # Default value is _null_.
  #
  listen_ipv4: null

  # Advertised IPv4 for Via, Record-Route and Path headers.
  # Useful when OverSIP runs behind a NAT and must expose the router public
  # IPv4 to the outside.
  # Default value is _null_ which means that the local IPv4 is used.
  #
  advertised_ipv4: null

  # Enable or disable IPv6. By default _yes_.
  #
  enable_ipv6: no

  # IPv6 in which OverSIP listens for SIP messages. Using "::" is not
  # allowed.
  # - Use an IPv6 string for listening in that address.
  # - Use _null_ for IP autodiscovery.
  # Default value is _null_.
  #
  listen_ipv6: null

  # Advertised IPv6 for Via, Record-Route and Path headers.
  # Useful when OverSIP runs behind a NAT and must expose the router public
  # IPv4 to the outside.
  # Default value is _null_ which means that the local IPv6 is used.
  #
  advertised_ipv6: null

  # Listening port for SIP over UDP and TCP.
  # By default 5060.
  #
  listen_port: 5060

  # Listening port for SIP over TLS.
  # By default 5061.
  #
  listen_port_tls: 5061

  # By enabling this option OverSIP does not listen in SIP TLS but, instead,
  # runs an instance of Stud TLS proxy which communicates with OverSIP using
  # plain TCP.
  # By default _yes_.
  #
  use_tls_tunnel: yes

  # The port which listens for TCP traffic from the Stud TLS proxy running in
  # this host.
  # By default 5062.
  #
  listen_port_tls_tunnel: 5062

  # Call the OverSIP::SipEvents.on_client_tls_handshake() callback when a SIP
  # client attemps a TLS handshake with OverSIP.
  # By default _yes_.
  #
  callback_on_client_tls_handshake: yes

  # Local domains OverSIP is responsible for.  Value can be:
  # - A domain.
  # - An array of domains.
  # - _null_: no one, just local IP's are matched as local destinations.
  # Default value is _null_.
  #
  # local domains: [ example.net, sip.example.org ]
  local_domains: null

  # TCP keepalive interval (in seconds).
  # When acting as a TCP server, OverSIP sends TCP packets with null data payload
  # as described in http://tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/TCP-Keepalive-HOWTO/.
  # If not set, TCP keepalive is disabled.
  # Minimun value is 180 seconds. Default value is _null_ (not enabled).
  #
  tcp_keepalive_interval: 300

  # Use a hostname for Record-Route/Path header when using TLS or WSS transports
  # over IPv4 (rather than using the server IP). This is good when a peer
  # sends us an in-dialog request via TLS so it could check whether the host part
  # of the top Route header matches a domain in the certificate we provide to it.
  # If not set, the server IPv4 will be used.
  # Default value is _null_ (IPv4 is used).
  #
  # record_route_hostname_tls_ipv4: outbound.example.net
  record_route_hostname_tls_ipv4: null

  # The same for IPv6.
  # If not set, the server IPv6 will be used.
  # Default value is _null_ (IPv6 is used).
  #
  # record_route_hostname_tls_ipv6: outbound.example.net
  record_route_hostname_tls_ipv6:  null
